     * @description: Approach 6: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm Intuition
     * 
     *               If we had some way of counting instances of the majority
     *               element as +1+1 and instances of any other element as -1âˆ’1,
     *               summing them would make it obvious that the majority element is
     *               indeed the majority element.
     * 
     *               Algorithm
     * 
     *               Essentially, what Boyer-Moore does is look for a suffix sufsuf
     *               of nums where suf[0]suf[0] is the majority element in that
     *               suffix. To do this, we maintain a count, which is incremented
     *               whenever we see an instance of our current candidate for
     *               majority element and decremented whenever we see anything else.
     *               Whenever count equals 0, we effectively forget about everything
     *               in nums up to the current index and consider the current number
     *               as the candidate for majority element. It is not immediately
     *               obvious why we can get away with forgetting prefixes of nums -
     *               consider the following examples (pipes are inserted to separate
     *               runs of nonzero count).
     * 
     *               [7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 1 | 5, 7 | 5, 5, 7, 7 | 7, 7, 7, 7]
     * 
     *               Here, the 7 at index 0 is selected to be the first candidate
     *               for majority element. count will eventually reach 0 after index
     *               5 is processed, so the 5 at index 6 will be the next candidate.
     *               In this case, 7 is the true majority element, so by
     *               disregarding this prefix, we are ignoring an equal number of
     *               majority and minority elements - therefore, 7 will still be the
     *               majority element in the suffix formed by throwing away the
     *               first prefix.
     * 
     *               [7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 1 | 5, 7 | 5, 5, 7, 7 | 5, 5, 5, 5]
     * 
     *               Now, the majority element is 5 (we changed the last run of the
     *               array from 7s to 5s), but our first candidate is still 7. In
     *               this case, our candidate is not the true majority element, but
     *               we still cannot discard more majority elements than minority
     *               elements (this would imply that count could reach -1 before we
     *               reassign candidate, which is obviously false).
     * 
     *               Therefore, given that it is impossible (in both cases) to
     *               discard more majority elements than minority elements, we are
     *               safe in discarding the prefix and attempting to recursively
     *               solve the majority element problem for the suffix. Eventually,
     *               a suffix will be found for which count does not hit 0, and the
     *               majority element of that suffix will necessarily be the same as
     *               the majority element of the overall array.
